// Reflectance.c
// Provide functions to take measurements using a QTR-8RC reflectance
// sensor array (Pololu part number 961).  This works by outputting to
// the sensor, waiting, then reading the digital value of each of the
// eight phototransistors.  The more reflective the target surface is,
// the faster the voltage decays.

// ------------Reflectance_Init------------
// Initialize the GPIO pins associated with the QTR-8RC
// reflectance sensor.  Infrared illumination LEDs are
// initially off.
// Input: none
// Output: none

    // P7.0-7 are the IR reflectance sensor initialize to GPIO, input

}

// ------------Reflectance_Read------------
// Objective: Read the eight sensors
//
// Algorithm
// 1. Turn on the 8 IR LEDs (connected to P5.3)
// 2. Pulse the 8 sensors (P7) high for 10 us
//    - make them outputs and set them all to 1
// 3. Make the 8 sensors (P7) input
// 4. wait t us
// 5. Read sensors (P7)
// 6. Turn off the 8 IR LEDs (connect to P5.3) to save power

// 4. wait t us
// 5. Read sensors (P7) - preserving ONLY p7.4 (left) and p7.3 (right)
// 6. Turn off the 8 IR LEDs (connect to P5.3) to save power
// 7. Convert the sensor response to a value from 0-3 as
//    described in the Output (Hint: use bit shifting!!)

// ------------Reflectance_Start------------
